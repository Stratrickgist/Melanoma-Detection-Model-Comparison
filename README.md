# Melanoma Detection Model Comparison

This project compares melanoma image segmentation and classification results for U-Net and O-Net.

O-Net is an image segmentation algorithm that is based off the U-Net, one of the most popular image segmentation algorithms in the medical field. This is unique in a sense that an image classification algorithm is embedded in the architecture itself.
