# O-Net-Replication

This project aims to look at successful melanoma image segmentation and classification for skin lesions using O-Net. 

O-Net is an image segmentation algorithm that is based off U-Net, one of the most popular image segmentation algorithms in the medical field. This is unique in a sense that an image classification algorithm is embedded in the architecture itself.
